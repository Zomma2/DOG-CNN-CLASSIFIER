# DOG-CNN-CLASSIFIER
> Build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

> Exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, Making important design decisions about the user experience for app.Goal is understand the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline. Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems without a perfect answer.Imperfect solution will nonetheless create a fun user experience!
